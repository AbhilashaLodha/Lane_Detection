# Lane_Detection
The project helps in detecting lanes on open source dataset namely "BDD100K Lane Marking Dataset" consisting of street images using deep learning model built with Keras on top of TensorFlow framework.

The steps involved in building up the project are -
1. Data Preprocessing 
2. Building a Fully Connected Neural Network
3. Model Training
4. Saving the model
5. Prediction on new test data

# Software Requirements
Python 3.7.2 with a supporting IDE (Spyder, Jupyter Notebook etc.)
Install requisite libraries using below command -
pip install -r requirements.txt
